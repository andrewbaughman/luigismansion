        <i>September 6, 2020</i>
        <p class="blogpost">Since taking the first week of Content Management, I have completely redesigned my website to reflect what I've learned. I want the site to be clear, appealing, and clutter free. I've learned about the two types of websites: static and dynamic. Since my website will not need to change for each user, I've decided to continue using a static website. In order to make the website more appealing to users, I've redesigned the way the blog looks. Also, I've added multiple pages and a navigation bar for ease of use.</p>

        <p class="blogpost">Luigi was the first of us to live. He was a strong spinach plant, but not strong enough. Neglected by his master toward the end of his life, Luigi died of drought and heat. This place has been made after his namesake, so that despite having no children, Luigi will be remembered.</p>
