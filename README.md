This is Luigi's Mansion.
============
###### *August 28th, 2020*

Luigi was the first of us to live. He was a strong spinach plant, but not strong enough. Neglected by his master toward the end of his life, Luigi died of drought and heat. This place has been made after his namesake, so that despite having no children, Luigi will be remembered.
