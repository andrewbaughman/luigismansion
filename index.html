        <h1 class="blogtitle">The History of Content Management in Industry</h1>
        <i>September 13, 2020</i>
        <p class="blogpost">Content management systems have not just sprung into existence in the 21st century alone. They have been developed over long periods of time by various companies, industries, and standards. While generalizing any history can be a dangerous process, the major facets of that have shaped content management and content management systems have played a huge role in the world at large and mainly can be contributed to three parts. The history of and advancements in content management can be contributed to the transition to digital media, the development of Graphical User Interfaces, and the operation of libraries in society.
	    </br></br>The transition to digital media, often called digitization, has shaped content management in profound ways throughout the last century. CD-ROM was an example of a major breakthrough in media and content management. Used by the multimedia industry, CD-ROM was the first medium that could store enough data to effectively be used to distribute content of all types, bringing the multimedia industry to its height. Over time, companies that used CD-ROMs created systems to display content in much the same way that full CMSs do now. This was about the same time as the term “asset” was used to describe a publication or piece of content that was owned by a person or group. The systems that were developed to display this information made the transition from CD-ROM to the Internet very easy. The rise of digitization was also very useful in other industries where documentation was very important. The transition from paper to CD-ROM was a huge benefit to companies such as Boeing, whose documentation for a 747 was reduced by several orders of magnitude thanks to digitization, thus reducing the cost of transporting that documentation in a similar fashion. Due to the necessity of digitization, content management systems were also developed by most industries in order to properly handle vast amounts of content. 
	    </br></br>Another factor that shaped the history of content management systems was the advent of Graphical User Interfaces, or GUIs. When GUIs were first created by computer and electrical engineers, others began to the abilities of the GUIs to present text in various fonts and formats. In addition to text, images, sound, and animations were eventually made possible to be displayed electronically, opening possibilities to content managers, producers, and distributors to make more lively and interesting content. The introduction of the internet only increased the attention to digitization and Graphical User Interfaces. Now that the medium was available to anyone who could connect, many more people started creating, managing, and presenting content online. This widespread use of Graphical User Interfaces lead to the development of SGML(Standard Generalized Markup Language), and later XML(Extensible Markup Language), which are both computer languages that define a set of rules for encoding documents in formats that are both human readable and machine readable. The use of such markup languages has helped produce content management systems that help users reading content and help managers and creators to produce and manage the content. The advent of GUIs impacted the development of content management systems in huge ways.
	    </br></br>An underrated operation within society, library systems, also made huge contributions to the development of content management systems. For the entirety of library existence, librarians have had to sift through countless data in the form of books, newspapers, and other forms of media, to make it easy for clients to access what they want to. This has made librarians and library systems prominent leaders in the testing of content management systems. With large amounts of books, periodicals, images, music, catalogs, etc., libraries have moved to digital formats over time and have been key to understanding how to organize and present that content well. Librarians have invented the hierarchies, indexes, cross references that a CMS must use. Hierarchies such as access structures are organization methods that are effectively taxonomical approaches to managing vast arrays of media. Indexes are ways of mapping keywords of one collection to each other and to keywords of another collections. Cross reference strategies connect books and other media to each other and show how various volumes are related, either by authorship or by context. These methods have helped develop not only the organization and presentation of content in the form of content management systems but has also aided various research fields. The author says that librarians are the gurus of the future. 
	    </br></br>Sure enough many things have influenced the development of content management systems, but most of all for our purposes were digitization in the form of CD-ROMs and later the internet, the advent and development in GUI, and the continual work of libraries and librarians. At first CD-ROMs enabled the multimedia industry to grow to huge proportions and serve the world at large by creating the necessity of useful CMSs as well as being later spurred by the dominance of the internet. Graphical User Interfaces also played a huge role as various industries realized that by utilizing GUIs, they could serve clients as well as internal needs in faster, more data driven, more cost effective means without bringing the extra need of computer training. As libraries offered there expertise in the way of organizing and presenting content usefully, content management systems have advanced to the stage where useful content is readily accessible, readily producible, and readily managed by anyone.
