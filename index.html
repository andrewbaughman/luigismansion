	A CMS usually begins as a single team and grows over time into a much larger organization. Due to this size, keeping the work moving and preventing issues and slowdowns becomes a complex process. To manage this process, various teams exist to serve various needs and to manage various hurdles that will arise. There are several team types involved in a CMS to keep it orderly and operational, and these teams would be facing challenges like stewarding creativity, ownership of the CMS, and good leadership. 
There are various teams that are needed for a successful CMS.
-	The CMS steering committee determines the direction of the CMS and can be made up of representatives from the project, members of significant contribution, and publication groups. This team sets CMS standards, integrates new teams, resolves content-sharing conflicts, and serves as the authority of a CMS.
-	The repository team keeps the system well maintained and manages its standards. This team does any maintenance, installations, solves integration issues, and updates CMS content schemas. 
-	Collection teams determine what their collections need. “As groups with content to contribute come into the picture, you can constitute collection teams whose purpose is to gather and submit a particular kind of information to the CMS.” Collection teams figure out how their project’s goals and requirements fit into those of the wider CMS. Authors, sources, components, and staff must also be defined by this team. It also is in charge of designing any additional conversion processes needed for using information from acquired sources. 
-	Publishing teams determine how their projects goals fit into the needs of the CMS. They analyze the publication needs, design page layout and content, and implement any software and hardware that is needed for their systems. 
	A very important question when managing a CMS is “Will the CMS stifle creativity in authors and publications?” This is a common hurdle that a CMS will face. CMS’s are structured, so creative people can sometimes feel repressed inside the CMS system. The struggle is that “many authors and publication specialists think that by putting together a CMS, they will no longer be able to express their creativity and will install become cogs in a system, endlessly producing the same product over and over.” In order to create good content, content creators as well as everyone making the CMS teams, need to feel as though they have creative freedom with the project, not just skills that are needed. In order to do this, CMS’s need to be standardized yet flexible. This can be done at any level, but is best when the top level understands this stance. 
	A second hurdle that most CMS’s will face is that of ownership. Though one group may have originally created the CMS, other’s will eventually have more authority over it than that group did. As the group grows, leadership of the project could change several times. Each time that leadership changes, the issue of ownership has the chance to arise. If there are inter-group rivalries in an organization, that organization risks failure in implementing a CMS. In order to counter this hurdle, the organization’s departments must be able to work together to plan and implement the CMS regardless of which group leads the effort. One way of doing this might actually be to recognize each groups or member’s contributions to the project regularly. 
	Something that can really be a large struggle for a CMS team is if it feels as though it doesn’t have any power. This can cause the team to feel as though it can’t get anything done if the leadership is involved. If this is the case, then the team might either make progress covertly, which erodes trust, or it might give up on meaningful progress entirely. Either of these situations is undesirable, so we should work to avoid them. In order to overcome this hurdle, either leadership needs to be changed if it really is disempowering the team, or the leadership needs to reinvigorate the team so that it feels empowered. 
	A CMS can be your biggest asset or your biggest downfall. If it fits naturally into the organization, and if the organization will let you do so, it can become fundamentally positive to the organization. CMS’s are meant to directly serve the organization’s need to produce and distribute value. Information should flow through well-worn channels. Figure out where these channels are and how to tap into them. Figure out how each group can play its part and isn’t excluded. The main aims are acceptance, scalability, and good content. If you design your CMS structure around these topics, it’ll work well. All in all, creating an effective CMS requires not only knowledge of what technical details and skills are needed for a CMS, but it also requires good leadership and communication skills.
